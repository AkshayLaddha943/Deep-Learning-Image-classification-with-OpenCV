# Deep-Learning-with-OpenCV

IMAGE CLASSIFICATION: 

GoogLeNet (also known as Inception V1) was the winner of LSVRC-2014, achieving a top-5 error rate of 6.67%, which is very close to human-level performance. 
This architecture is even deeper than VGGNet. However, it uses only one-tenth of the number of parameters of AlexNet (from 60 million to only 4 million parameters) 
due to the architecture of 9 parallel modules, the inception module, which is based on several very small convolutions with the objective of reducing the number of parameters.

OBJECT DETECTION:

Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is a single deep neural network developed to predict both the bounding boxes and the class probabilities at the same time by means of an 
end-to-end convolutional neural network architecture.

You only look once (YOLO) is a deep learning architecture that predicts both bounding boxes and class probabilities in a single step. Compared to other deep learning detectors, 
YOLO makes more localization errors, but it is less likely to predict false positives in the background.
